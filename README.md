A 4-bit Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) was designed and simulated using MATLAB Simulink. The project implemented the successive approximation algorithm to achieve precise analog-to-digital conversion, incorporating key components such as a comparator, SAR, and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Extensive testing and validation were conducted to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the design, with the simulation results demonstrating reliable performance. This project highlights the effectiveness of the SAR ADC architecture in achieving fast and precise conversions, making it suitable for various applications requiring efficient analog signal processing.
